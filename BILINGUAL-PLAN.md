# 🌐 Bilingual Support - Implementation Plan

## ✅ Yes, it's possible to have both languages working!

Here are your options:

---

## Option 1: Quick Fix (5 minutes)
**Add basic language switching to existing wireframes**

What it does:
- Language selector becomes functional
- Switches between English/Spanish
- Updates main text on each screen
- Simple and fast

Limitations:
- Not every single word translated
- Main screens only (landing, urgent support, browse peers)

---

## Option 2: Full Bilingual (30 minutes)
**Complete translation of all screens**

What it does:
- Every screen fully translated
- All buttons, labels, messages
- Dynamic content (peer names, ages, etc.)
- Professional implementation

Includes:
- Landing screen
- Onboarding (4 screens)
- Urgent support
- Browse peers
- Chat screen
- Offline messaging
- FAQ
- Crisis resources

---

## Option 3: Use Content Guide (Already exists!)
**You already have bilingual content!**

File: `content-guide.md`

Contains:
- ✅ Landing screen (EN/ES)
- ✅ Urgent support (EN/ES)
- ✅ Browse peers (EN/ES)
- ✅ Chat screen (EN/ES)
- ✅ Offline messaging (EN/ES)
- ✅ No peer available (EN/ES)
- ✅ Crisis resources (EN/ES)

I can use this to implement full bilingual support!

## 🎯 Which option do you want?

**Quick:** Just say "Option 1" - I'll add basic language switching now

**Complete:** Say "Option 2" or "Use the content guide" - I'll implement full bilingual support

**Custom:** Tell me which specific screens need translation

---

## 📝 What I recommend:

**Option 2** using your existing `content-guide.md` - You already have all the translations written! I just need to implement the switching logic.

This will give you:
- ✅ Professional bilingual support
- ✅ All screens translated
- ✅ Uses your approved content
- ✅ Working language selector
- ✅ Persistent language choice
